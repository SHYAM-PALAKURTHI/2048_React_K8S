Project Overview
This project showcases a complete DevOps workflow to automate the deployment of a 2048 game application. It involves:

Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform.
Continuous Integration (CI) using Jenkins.
Code quality checks with SonarQube.
Containerization with Docker.
Continuous Deployment (CD) to an EKS cluster using Helm.
Monitoring with AWS CloudWatch.
Architecture

The architecture includes:

User initiates the process using Terraform.
Terraform provisions an EC2 instance with Jenkins.
Jenkins orchestrates the build process:
Builds the application using Node.js and npm.
Scans code with SonarQube.
Pushes Docker images to Docker Hub.
Terraform creates an EKS cluster and EC2 nodes.
Helm deploys the application on the EKS cluster.
End Users access the 2048 game application via the web.
AWS CloudWatch monitors the application.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Terraform
Jenkins
Docker
Kubernetes (kubectl)
Helm
AWS CLI
Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/SHYAM-PALAKURTHI/2048_React_K8S.git
cd 2048_React_K8S
2. Provision Infrastructure
Use Terraform to create the necessary infrastructure:

sh
Copy code
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
3. Set Up Jenkins
Access Jenkins on the Provisioned EC2 Instance:

Use SSH to connect to the EC2 instance where Jenkins is installed.
Example command:
sh
Copy code
ssh -i path/to/your-key-pair.pem ec2-user@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
Install Jenkins and Required Plugins:

Update the package manager and install Jenkins:
sh
Copy code
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y java-1.8.0-openjdk
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
sudo yum install jenkins -y
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
Access Jenkins at http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080 and complete the initial setup.
Install necessary plugins: NodeJS, Docker, and SonarQube Scanner.
Set Up the Jenkins Pipeline:

Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
Use the provided Jenkinsfile from the repository for the pipeline script.
4. Configure SonarQube
Set Up a SonarQube Server:

Provision an EC2 instance for SonarQube or use an existing server.
Install SonarQube:
sh
Copy code
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y wget unzip
wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonarqube/sonarqube-8.9.2.46101.zip
unzip sonarqube-8.9.2.46101.zip
sudo mv sonarqube-8.9.2.46101 /opt/sonarqube
sudo useradd sonar
sudo chown -R sonar:sonar /opt/sonarqube
sudo -u sonar /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64/sonar.sh start
Access SonarQube at http://<SonarQube_SERVER_IP>:9000 and complete the initial setup.
Add the SonarQube Authentication Token to Jenkins:

In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials.
Add a new credential for the SonarQube token.
5. Deploy to EKS using Helm
Ensure kubeconfig is Configured for the EKS Cluster:

Update the kubeconfig file:
sh
Copy code
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <your-region> --name <your-cluster-name>
Deploy the Application with Helm:

Package and deploy the Helm chart:
sh
Copy code
cd helm-chart
helm package .
helm install my-release ./my-helm-chart-0.1.0.tgz
CI/CD Pipeline
The Jenkins pipeline (Jenkinsfile) includes the following stages:

Clean Workspace: Cleans the workspace to ensure a fresh build.
Checkout from Git: Pulls the latest code from the repository.
Print Environment Variables: Prints environment variables for debugging.
SonarQube Analysis: Analyzes the code for quality and security issues.
Install Dependencies: Installs Node.js dependencies.
Build and Push Docker Image: Builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.
Security Aspects
Continuous Code Inspection with SonarQube üîçüõ°Ô∏è

Continuously inspected code for vulnerabilities to ensure secure and high-quality code deployments.
Consistent Security Policies with Terraform üìúüîí

Defined and enforced consistent security policies across the infrastructure, reducing the risk of manual errors.
Container Security Best Practices üê≥üîê

Implemented best practices for container security, including image security and vulnerability scanning before pushing to Docker Hub.
Kubernetes Security Best Practices üîê‚öôÔ∏è

Applied Kubernetes security best practices, including namespace isolation, network policies, and role-based access control (RBAC) to secure cluster resources.
Real-Time Monitoring and Alerting with AWS CloudWatch üìàüîî

Configured AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and alerting, enabling prompt detection and response to security incidents.
Monitoring
Setting Up AWS CloudWatch for Monitoring
Create IAM Role for CloudWatch:

Create an IAM role with policies to allow your EKS nodes to send logs and metrics to CloudWatch.
Example policy:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Attach this policy to your EKS nodes.
Install CloudWatch Agent on EKS Nodes:

Use the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) or manually install the CloudWatch agent on your EKS nodes.
Example command:
sh
Copy code
kubectl apply -f https://amazon-cloudwatch-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/kubernetes/quickstart.yaml
Configure CloudWatch Agent:

Create a configuration file for the CloudWatch agent to define what metrics and logs to collect.
Example configuration (cloudwatch-config.json):
json
Copy code
{
  "agent": {
    "metrics_collection_interval": 60,
    "logfile": "/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.log"
  },
  "logs": {
    "logs_collected": {
      "files": {
        "collect_list": [
          {
            "file_path": "/var/log/messages",
            "log_group_name": "eks-log-group",
            "log_stream_name": "{instance_id}"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "metrics": {
    "metrics_collected": {
      "cpu": {
        "measurement": [
          "cpu_usage_idle",
          "cpu_usage_iowait",
          "cpu_usage_user",
          "cpu_usage_system"
        ],
        "metrics_collection_interval": 60
      },
      "mem": {
        "measurement": [
          "mem_used_percent"
        ],
        "metrics_collection_interval": 60
      }
    }
  }
}
Deploy CloudWatch Agent Configuration:

Apply the CloudWatch agent configuration to your EKS cluster.
